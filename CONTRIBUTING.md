## Local Setup

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DadaNanjesha/GitHub-issue-creator.git
   cd GitHub-issue-creator
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```env
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=owner_name
   GITHUB_REPO_NAME=repo_name
   ```
   - Get a GitHub token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope.

5. **Run the CLI**:
   ```bash
   python app.py 
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Python Standards
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines.
- Use type hints for clarity.
- Format code with **Black**:
  ```bash
  black .
  ```
- Lint with **flake8**:
  ```bash
  flake8
  ```
- Document functions with docstrings (Google-style):
  ```python
  def create_issue(title: str) -> dict:
      """Creates a GitHub issue.
      
      Args:
          title (str): Issue title
      
      Returns:
          dict: API response
      """
  ```

### Testing
- Write tests using **pytest** in the `tests/` directory.
- Run tests with:
  ```bash
  pytest -v
  ```
- Ensure 100% test coverage (if applicable):
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=.
  ```

### Documentation
- Update the README.md for:
  - New CLI arguments/flags
  - Changes to authentication
  - Examples of usage
- Use `argparse` or `click` help strings for CLI documentation.
